Resource	Estimated Annual Cost (USD)
EC2 Instance (t2.micro)	~$90
S3 Bucket (50 GB Storage + Static Website Hosting)	~$12
AWS Lambda (Minimal Usage)	~$0 (Within Free Tier)
Data Transfer (1 GB per Month)	~$12
Total Estimated Cost	~$114 per year
Notes:
The EC2 instance cost is based on running a t2.micro instance 24/7 for 12 months under standard on-demand pricing (without Reserved Instances or Savings Plans).

S3 storage cost assumes ~50 GB storage with minimal request and data transfer charges.

Lambda remains within the AWS Free Tier limits (1 million requests and 400,000 GB-seconds compute time per month).

Data transfer out to internet is estimated for 1 GB per month at standard AWS rates.
